I’ve built many devices; but, I love creating robots. As the Captain and Co-Founder of the FIRST Tech Challenge all-girl robotics team at The Spence School, I’ve developed our team from scratch, significantly improving our robots’ sophistication over time. My team has no mentors, so we rely on my guidance and teaching.

Our first robot picked up spheres using 2 rubber bands stretched across channels. The following year, we used new mechanisms like stealth wheels and linear slides. Since we couldn’t compete during Covid, I focused on teaching my team computer-aided design, Java programming, and how to use robotic mechanisms. Those efforts paid off—we won 3 awards next season and advanced to NYC Championships again. This year’s bot uses a mecanum wheeled holonomic drive and a joint intake/outtake system inspired by an upside down umbrella! 

Solving a seemingly impossible problem is what makes my learning purposeful and drives my passion for robotics.
