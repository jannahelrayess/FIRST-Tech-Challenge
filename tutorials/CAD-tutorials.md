Below I have linked 2 CAD tutorials that I recorded to be used/referenced 
in the future for my Robotics Team. I also gave live demos that were recorded 
but have not been cut/edited, so have been omitted. The purpose of teaching my
team CAD was to build our robot virtually due to COVID-19, but now has become a 
useful skill when planning our Robot deisgn and 3D printing custom parts.

The following tutorials have been made using OnShape (a computer-aided design software).
