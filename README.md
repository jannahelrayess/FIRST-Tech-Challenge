# First-Tech-Challenge
This repository contains the java code for my robotics team's robot and our engineering portfolios from only the freight frenzy and power play seasons. The majority of this repository, though, contains a select few tutorials and lesson plans I put together for my team to teach them new skills that I first taught myself.
